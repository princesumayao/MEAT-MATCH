                    <li>Add mushrooms to the frying pan and saute until mushrooms have sweated off most of their moisture.</li>

                    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>

                <h2>Step by step procedure:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                    <li>To make the sauce: In a small bowl, combine the Gorgonzola and vinegar. Mash with a fork until almost creamy (some lumps will remain).</li>
                    <li>Stir in the sour cream and olive oil until blended. Stir in the parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Generously season the steaks on both sides with the salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>In a large, heavy skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the steaks and cook for 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium-rare, or 5 to 6 minutes for medium.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the steaks to serving plates and let rest for 5 minutes. Spoon the sauce over the steaks or serve on the side.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Tips!</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gorgonzola sauce is great on these steaks, but also try it on pasta, chicken, or pork.</li>
                    <li>It is important to let the steaks rest for about 5 minutes after they've been cooked and before you serve them. The cooling-off period gives the juices a chance to evenly distribute throughout the meat, as they tend to migrate to the center while being cooked. This will keep the meat juicy and tender, and when you cut it, the juices won't run all over the cutting board.</li>
                    <li>In general, never freeze cheese, as the texture will deteriorate quickly, and it may lose some of its flavors.</li>

                <p>This large steak can feed two or more people, and it can easily be prepared at home. This recipe includes a garlic-thyme butter sauce that really takes the dish to the next level. Serve it with a full-bodied red wine like cabernet sauvignon and a veggie side, and recreate this classic steakhouse splurge for a fraction of the cost.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tomahawk rib-eye steak, about 1 3/4 inches thick</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>1 small head garlic</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons oil, plus more for drizzling (canola or<br> grapeseed)</li>
                    <li>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>4 large sprigs fresh thyme</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step by step procedure:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 F.</li>
                    <li>Pat the tomahawk steak dry with paper towels.</li>
                    <li>Season very liberally with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Let the steak come to room temperature.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, prepare the garlic. Trim off the top 1/4 inch of the garlic bulb. Drizzle with the oil and add a pinch of salt, then wrap in a foil tent, and roast the garlic for 30 minutes, until the cloves are soft. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. Increase the oven temperature to 425 F.</li>
                    <li>Optional: Moisten a paper towel and wrap it around the steak's rib bone, then wrap aluminum foil around the paper towel.</li>
                    <li>In a large heavy-duty skillet (preferably cast-iron), heat the 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat until it's just starting to smoke. Lay the tomahawk steak into the skillet and sear for 3 minutes without touching it. (Step back a bit since it will smoke and spatter.)</li>
                    <li>Using tongs and the bone as a handle, turn the steak over and cook for another 3 minutes without touching it. Using tongs and the bone as a handle, sear the short side of the steak opposite the bone, about 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the steak to a rimmed baking sheet and place in the oven, roasting 9 to 10 minutes, or until the desired doneness is reached.</li>
                    <li>Use an instant-read thermometer to measure the steak's internal temperature―125 F for rare, 135 F for medium-rare, or 145 F for medium. The meat will continue to cook while it rests and increase by 5 to 10 degrees, so take that into account when pulling your steak out of the oven.</li>
                    <li>While the steak is in the oven, add the butter to the skillet and melt over low heat. Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves into the butter, stirring with a wooden spoon to distribute, then add the thyme sprigs and continue to cook, about 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>When the steak is ready, take it out of the oven, and transfer it back into the skillet. Use a spoon to baste the butter and garlic over the steak. Turn the steak, and baste again, about 1 minute total. Transfer the steak to a cutting board, tent it with foil, and let it rest 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If you've wrapped the bone in the optional paper towel and foil, remove it now. </li>
                    <li>Slice the steak against the grain, then drizzle with more of the butter and garlic. Serve and enjoy.</li>
